                    <p>Family is our first module designed to help people outside 
                    of your care service to stay in touch with their loved ones. 
                    It simplifies the way that care notes and care records are 
                    viewed by giving family and friends access to your service usersâ€™ 
                    care information in a simplified timeline in the Family App.

                    access to their very own care platform. Keep them up-to-date
